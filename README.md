LaTeXAddIn is a ribbon Add-In for Microsoft Excel 2007~2013 to convert the data in Excel to a LaTeX table environment.

The Add-In is developed in C# with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

It depends on
    
    *Microsoft .NET Framework4 Client Profile

    *Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Tools for Office Runtime

    *Windows Installer 4.5

The LaTeX table environment is generated on purpose for journal publications, which usually requires three-line tables.

The generated LaTeX code is copied into the clipboard of the system by default
so that it can be pasted to any editor conveniently.

The Add-In can also export the code to a local file.
